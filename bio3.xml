	<title><![CDATA[WHAT IS ELECTROLYSIS?]]></title>
	<text><![CDATA[Electrolysis is the specialty of permanent hair removal utilizing only solid needle type devices. <br><br>A trained electrologist inserts a very fine probe into the natural opening of the hair follicle alongside the hair. A small amount of electrical current is then applied which destroys the cells that cause hair growth. <br><br>Electrolysis is a process of elimination, therefore, it needs a series of appointments to deal with different hair cycles. <br><br>Electrolysis has over 130 years of history. It is a safe, effective, and medically proven method of permanent hair removal. This is the only permanent hair removal method approved by the FDA.
