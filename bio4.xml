	<text><![CDATA[In 1875 – Dr. Charles E. Michel, ophthalmologist in St. Louis, Missouri reported his findings to the medical profession that he had been able to remove ingrowing eyelashes with galvanic(direct) current. <br><br>In 1916 – Prof. Paul M. Kree developed multiple needle technique with galvanic(direct) current to remove excessive hair growth. <br><br>In 1887 – High-frequency had its beginning when German scientist, Heinrich Hertz, developed the oscillator. <br><br>In 1923 – Dr. Henri E. Bordier of Lyon, France was the first to experiment with High-frequency as a means of permanent hair removal. <br><br>In 1948 – A patent is granted to Henri E. St-Pierre and Arthur Hinkel for the invention for the Blend(combination of galvanic(direct) current and high-frequency). <br><br>Three recognized methods(modalities) which are safe and effective in electrolysis :<ul><li><br>Galvanic electrolysis (direct current) – the hair root is destroyed by chemical action. <br></li><li>Thermolysis electrolysis (high frequency) – the hair root is destroyed by heat production. <br><br>Blend electrolysis (combination of above two) – the hair root is destroyed by both heat and chemical action at the same time. </li></ul><br>After the discovery of electrolysis, an enormous amount of research has been devoted to the field. It has been analysed, and has made a great improvement, constantly being modified. <br><br>Electrolysis still remains as safe, effective, and the only true permanent hair removal method approved by the FDA.
